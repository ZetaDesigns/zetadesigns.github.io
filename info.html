<h2>What is Homebrew?</h2>
<ul>Homebrew is usually software that has not been authorized by the company behind the system, in our case Nintendo.<br>
	Some things you can do with Homebrew are: save editing and backup, emulators for older systems and homebrew games. <br> On most firmware versions, accessing the Homebrew Launcher is totally free, using the <a href="https://3ds.guide/homebrew-launcher-(soundhax)">Nintendo 3DS Sound app.</a> <br> However, if you are on 11.4 or above, you need an alternate method(requires an exploitable game like Cubic Ninja or Freaky Forms Deluxe) of entering the Homebrew Launcher. <br> </ul>
<h2>What is CFW?</h2>
<ul>CFW stands for Custom Firmware. It allows us to use more advanced hacks than normal userland homebrew. <br> 
For example signature patches let us install apps directly to the Homemenu and the Homebrew Launcher can be accessed anytime. <br> Because of the super awesome boot9strap (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ, CFW is now possible on every Firmware! The recommended guide to install it, is <a href="https://3ds.guide"> Plailects written guide.</a></ul>
<h2>What is a NAND/SYSNAND?</h2>
<ul>The NAND is a chip on the motherboard of your 3DS, and it is the main storage of your console, similar to a HDD on your Computer. It is where everything on the system itself is stored, like the HOME Menu or the Sound app. The NAND is often called SYSNAND. </ul>
<h2>What is an EmuNAND?</h2>
<ul>An EmuNAND is a copy of your SysNAND that runs from your SD-Card. It was often used to access online features when you needed to stay on a lower firmware because of a Gateway cart or to stay on a firmware that had an arm9 exploit available.<br><b>NOTE: For the average user, an EmuNAND is completely useless these days. Everything can be done on SysNAND, and it will only damage your SD.</b></ul>
<h2>What is a Dump?</h2>
<ul>A Dump is a copy of a storage medium, in our case it's a cartridge or an installed title. A crash dump however is often used to diagnose and fix bugs in software. If you want to dump a title yourself, you can find a guide <a target="_blank" href="https://pastebin.com/sx8HYULr">here</a></ul>
