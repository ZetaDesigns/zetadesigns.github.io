<h2><font face= "arial" color = #E9E9E9>What is Homebrew?</font></h2>
<p><font face= "arial" color = #E9E9E9> Homebrew is usually software that has not been authorized by the company behind the system, in our case Nintendo.<br>
	Some things you can do with Homebrew are: save editing and backup, emulators for older systems and homebrew games. <br> On most firmware versions, accessing smeas Homebrew Launcher is totally free, using the <a href="https://3ds.guide/homebrew-launcher-(soundhax)" style="color: aliceblue">Nintendo 3DS Sound app.</a> <br> However, if you are on 11.4 or above, you need an alternate method(requires an exploitable game like Cubic Ninja or Freaky Forms Deluxe) of entering the Homebrew Launcher. <br></font> </p>
<h2><font face= "arial" color = #E9E9E9>What is CFW?</font></h2>
<p><font face= "arial" color = #E9E9E9>CFW stands for Custom Firmware. It allows us to use more advanced hacks than normal userland homebrew. <br> 
For example signature patches let us install apps directly to the Homemenu and the Homebrew Launcher can be accessed anytime. <br> Because of the super awesome boot9strap (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ, CFW is now possible on every Firmware!</font></p>
