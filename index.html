<h1>What is this website for?</h1>
<p>I'll host/write some guides for things that are not explained on Plailects guide. But the main purpose of this guide is to explain the basic terms of 3DS hacking, see the <a href="info.html">information section.</a></p>
<h1>Who made this website?</h1>
	<p>The website itself was made by Zeta, but the guide have been written by several people, Slade/Jisagi responsible for the workings on the randomizing guide, Rad1 made the Pokemon Prism Save guide.</p>
<h1>How can I contact you?</h1>
<p>The easiest way would be through Discord, you can find me on the Nintendo Homebrew server: Zeta#3515. I also have a <a href="https://gbatemp.net/members/zetadesigns.423818/">GBATemp profile.</a></p>
