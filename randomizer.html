–	Open pk3ds, then select the folder you just created (with ExtractedRomFS and ExtractedExeFS inside) <br>
–	Randomize your game, then save <br>
–	Put the two folders back into /Packhack/, where the other game files are <br>




3. Rebuilding and installing CIA <br>

–	Enter CR to rebuild the CIA <br> 
–	When prompted, enter the name for your modded CIA, this will take pretty long<br>
–	Enter “0” two times<br>

–	Launch FBI<br>
–	Navigate to the CIA on your SD card and install it<br>
–	Done!
