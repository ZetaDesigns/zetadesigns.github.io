<h1>Creating an EmuNAND</h1>
    <p>To complete this guide, Luma3DS needs to be installed.</p>
    <p class="warning">Please do <i>not</i> follow this guide, if you don't know what exactly you are doing. For the average user, an EmuNAND is completely useless, and it will only create issues or damage your SD.
    If you don't have a good reason to create one, don't follow this. </p>
    <p class="info">During this guide, your SD Card will get formatted. It will go through backing everything up, but if you don't follow that, you will <i>lose</i> everything on your SD Card.</p>
    <p>If you have any issues during the process of this guide, you can get help on the <a href="https://discord.gg/C29hYvh">Nintendo Homebrew Discord</a></p>
